You have a normal six sided cube.
I give you six different colors that you can paint each side of the cube with ( one color to each side ).
How many different cubes can you make?

NOTE: Different means that the cubes can not be rotated so that they look the same. This is important! If you give me two cubes and I can rotate them so that they appear identical in color, they are the same cube.

Solution : 30
